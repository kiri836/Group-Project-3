# COP3530 Dictionary Definition Generator

Group 59

## Overview

This project allows users to input a word and receive its dictionary definition using two different search methods: **linear search** and **trie-based search**. The program compares the execution time of both methods and displays the results to the user. The program also allows the user to see all words matching an inputted prefix. 

## Dataset
